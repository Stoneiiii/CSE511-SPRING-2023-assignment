# Introduction

The last assignment shows how to use Fragmentation in different methods within PostgreSQL. The task in this assignment is to build a simplified query processor that accesses data from the partitioned rating tables there.

# Problem Statement

We have already provided the code that creates the subreddits table and partitioned tables as well for you already. The same environment will be maintained in the grading environment as well where you only need to perform implementations on the queries and nothing else. For this particular assignment, we have divided the problem statement into two high-level steps. Further information about the provided functions has also been made available in the assignment4.py file.

1. Step 1: Range Query
2. Step 2: Point Query
