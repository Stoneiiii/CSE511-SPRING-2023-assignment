# Introduction

Here are the assignments and projects I completed in this course.

# About this course:

Database systems are used to provide convenient access to disk-resident data through efficient query processing, indexing structures, concurrency control, and recovery. This course delves into new frameworks for storing, processing, and generating large-scale datasets with parallel and distributed algorithms, covering the design, deployment, and use of state-of-the-art data processing systems, which provide scalable access to data.

# Specific topics covered include

- Efficient query processing
- Distributed database design
- Parallel query execution
- Concurrency control in distributed parallel database systems
- Data management in Map/Reduce-based systems
- Spark and other major data processing platforms
- Graph, streaming, and other new database and processing platforms.
- Storage systems
- Indexing structures
- NoSQL database systems
- Private cloud including Openstack and Kubernetes.
- Data management in public cloud computing environments
- Cloud computing and data processing integration

# Learning Outcomes:

Learners completing this course will be able to

- Differentiate among major data models such as relational, spatial, and NoSQL
- Perform queries (e.g., SQL) and analytics tasks in state-of-the-art database systems
- Perform NoSQL queries and is able to optimize the state-of-the-art NoSQL databases
- Apply leading-edge techniques to design/tune distributed and parallel database systems
- Utilize existing NoSQL database systems as appropriate for specified cases
- Have a full understanding of the data infrastructure including storage devices, storage systems, databases, data analytic platforms, and data processing pipelines
- Perform database operations (e.g., selection, projection, join, and group by) in state-of-the-art cluster computing systems such as Hadoop/Spark
- Perform data processing in other specific platforms like graph processing, streaming processing, and others.
- Perform scalable data processing operations (e.g., selection, projection, join, and group by) in cloud computing environments, including Amazon AWS, Openstack, and Kubernetes.
