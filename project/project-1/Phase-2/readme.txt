Thanking for grading us.

All group members participated the project meeting on 2/23 and have equal contribution to the tasks. 

The project was done after group discussion and collaboration.

The HotcellAnalysis's result is a little different when I take "yellow-trip-sample-100000.csv" as the input file, but the result is totally the same when using yellow_tripdata_2009-01_point.csv as input.
